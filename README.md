# Seldonian

This is the source code repository for a framework for creating and running [Seldonian](aisafety) algorithms. 

## Installation
To run this code as a developer, you will need Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Once Anaconda is installed, create the conda environment for this library from the command line using: 
``` bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a virtual python environment called `seldo` which you need to activate before running the code in this repository. Activate it via:
```
conda activate seldo
```

If you want to use view the parse tree graphs using the built-in tools this library provides, install [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/). The Seldonian library uses a Python API for graphviz, and the API requires that graphviz be installed system-wide. This should resolve mysterious error messages like "dot" not found. "dot" is a command line program included with graphviz for rendering the graphs from code. 

## Interface

This library is in its infancy, but a lite command line interface exists for parsing string expressions into parse trees. To use this interface, edit the file: `interface.py` by modifying `constraint_str` and `delta` to your values of interest. Then run (make sure you have activated the `seldo` conda environment first):
```
python interface.py
```
As a quick test, if you use the following variables:
```
constraint_str = 'abs((Mean_Error | M) - (Mean_Error | F)) - 0.1'
delta = 0.05
```
The resulting diagram should match [this one](example_graph.pdf), although the actual intervals may be different due to the random seeding of the base variable intervals. 

## Testing
To run the unit tests, from the command line do:
```
pytest
```

This will automatically run all tests in `tests/`. Currently, there is only one test file in this folder, called `test_parse_tree.py`. Pytest will find that file and run all tests within that file. 

To get more introspection into the tests see the [Pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/).
